# Activities/TuxExplorer
Tux is a space exploration game made for the [IGME-582 Final Project at Rochester Institute of Technology](https://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss/wiki/final).
This game seeks to teach the standard "Identify angles as acute, right, or obtuse" from 4.G.4 of the [Curriculum Chart](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Math4Team/Resources/Curriculum_Chart).

## Description
Tux is exploring space. Tell him what kind of angle he needs to use to get to the next planet!

Planets will be generated at a random angle of 0<angle<180 on a 15deg increment for clarity.
The angle will be drawn in the background to help build the concept in (the other part of the angle will be from the right because of the Unit Circle), Tux will be at the center, and the planet/asteroid that Tux is going to will be on the end of the angle.

## To do
* Animations
* Starfield background
* Increase the difficulty as the game progresses
  * Start with fewer angles, increase variation over time
  * Start angles from different places (not all from 0deg on unit circle)
* Make the planet scaling more reliable
  * The images used are not a consistent size
